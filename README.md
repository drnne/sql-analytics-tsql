# SQL & T-SQL Analytics Portfolio

This repository contains selected examples of **SQL and T-SQL** used for analytics, reporting, and KPI monitoring in complex operational environments.

The queries demonstrate patterns commonly required in **Data Analyst and Data Scientist roles**, including KPI aggregation, statistical inputs, data quality checks, and time-series analysis.

All examples use **synthetic or anonymised structures** designed to reflect real-world database schemas.
